# projectcode_sample
Sample code created using html. JPDB is also used for the queries.
I,ve done this code by refering the tutorials you provided.
After coming to github by the link please refer the projectcode_sample the code is in it.
I have created the login page of Student Management System which includes Studentid,Studentname and StudentEmail respectively,where student have to fill the details for the login.
Using JsonPowerDB was very much fun and very much easy,because reduces time and has great features.
The path for project is -projectcode_sample/public_html/Project_sample.html.
Thankyou.
